<p align="center"><font size ="4">The corvette Z06 is probably my favorite car of all time. It is my dream car that I would absolutely love to have.
  </font> </p>
<p align="center"><font size ="4">
  There are many things that make the Z06 attractive to me. Here are some of them:</font> </p>
<ul align="center">
  <li>It comes stock with 650 horsepower</li>
  <li>It is considered a luxuary car for only 80k$!(which is still a lot of money but is less than other simalar perfoming cars)</li>
  <li>It has decent gas milage at around 22 mpg Highway</li>
</ul>
