    <td>1 cup soy sauce</td>
    <td>Slice Asian pears into 1/4"-thick chips, irregular shapes are fine.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>1/3 cup sesame oil</td>
    <td>Nestle ribs in a roasting pan or pile in a large, sturdy re-sealable plastic bag.
       Scatter pear around ribs then pour over marinade. <br> Turn ribs to ensure they are evenly coated. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 24 hours.  Turn ribs at least once during the marination.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/4 cup brown sugar</td>
    <td>Prepare the grill. A gas grill will work but, according to Gregory,
      "Koreans prefer the char of charcoal." Third choice is a broiler.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>8 green onions, trimmed and chopped roughly</td>
      <td>Drain excess marinade off ribs and reserve. Cook ribs, turning often with metal tongs.
        Depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of the grill, this may take as little as 5 minutes, or as many as 15 minutes. Tend the grill carefully, watching for flare-ups which can be put out with a cupful of water.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td>8-10 cloves of garlic, minced</td>
        <td>Toward the end of the cooking process, pour remaining marinade over ribs, cook another minute to caramelize, then pull off to check for done-ness. Gregory's tip is to cut a piece and taste it. The middle should look the way you like your steaks to look, which is probably not too bloody, and definitely not too dry.</td>

  <tr>
          <td>2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root</td>
          <td>Serve with rice, torn lettuce and a julienne of green onions, and a sesame oil and soy sauce dressing.</td>
